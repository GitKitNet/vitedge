# Requirements

## Development

Vitedge relies on native ES Modules. Therefore, during development, it is recommended using Node version `>=14`, but `12.x` should also work.

## Production

For deploying to Cloudflare workers, you will need an account with the [Workers Bundled plan](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites#plans) (\$5/mo).

Other providers (Netlify, Vercel, etc.) offer free tier generally.
